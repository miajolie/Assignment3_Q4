The Kotlin app consists of the following features:
- Scaffold with TopAppBar showing app title
- Bottom NavigationBar with 3 items (Home, Settings, Profile)
- FloatingActionButton that triggers Snackbar
- Proper innerPadding applied to avoid overlap
- 
The App should display and present the home screen.
To toggle, click the settings tab or the profile tab to view those screens
The Floating action button also displays a snack bar with a bonus message :)
